## Data Sources
The dataset used for the HR attrition analysis contains 1470 rows and 35 columns, each revealing a unique facet of the organizational landscape. Core columns, such as employee number, age, and gender, offer fundamental insights into the demographic makeup of the workforce. 
The “attrition” column, split into “yes” and “no,” serves as the focus, driving the analysis of employee turnover. Additional parameters, ranging from department and marital status to job involvement, satisfaction levels, monthly income, and tenure-related metrics like years in the current role and years since the last promotion, create a detailed understanding of the dynamics within the organization. 
This dataset serves as a base for a comprehensive exploration of the factors influencing attrition, allowing for a detailed examination of the interplay between personal and professional variables that shape the employment journey.

## Task to perform
Data Cleaning:
• Deleting redundant columns.
• Renaming the columns.
• Dropping duplicates.
• Cleaning individual columns.
• Remove the NaN values from the dataset
• Check for some more Transformations
Data Visualization:

I downloaded the dataset and uploaded the data using the "Get Data" option in 
Power BI. Then, I utilized the "Transform" option to check for any null values 
in the dataset.

Evaluate the compensation structure for these roles, ensuring it aligns with industry standards. Additionally, assess whether the responsibilities and expectations associated with these positions match the compensation offered.
